        <dt>App Functions:</dt>
        <dd> - This app takes input from the user of keywords or video/channel links and is able to retrieve<br>
           search results from YouTube's servers and give information on those results. This app also takes<br>
           those results and runs them through the ReturnYouTubeDislikes API, which gives ratings information<br>
           for the video results and displays those as well. In the search section, there are multiple modifiers<br>
           that the user can use, such as modifying the amount of results that appear per page, and how results<br>
           are ordered using the dropdown menu of options (the default is relevance). The user can also flip through<br>
           multiple pages of results using the next and previous page buttons located at the bottom of the app.</dd><br>

        <dt>How does this app satisfy the criteria of this assignment?</dt>

                <li>
                    Our app is deployed both on GitHub and on stu <br>
                    (GitHub url is at the top, stu url:<a href="http://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/wistjp/343f22/CS343-p2/">http://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/wistjp/343f22/CS343-p2/</a>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our app is responsive and changes size and alignment based upon the size of the screen viewing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our app makes use of the YouTube api to get video and channel search results and the ReturnYouTubeDislikes API<br>
                    to get ratings information for those videos.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our app makes use of search as the user inputs a query, which is modifiable to search based on<br>
                    certain criteria, such as view count, ratings, alphabetically based on title, etc. This then displays<br>
                    the results of the search as the results from the APIs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our app displays results based on the query entered by the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The user can filter the results using the modifiers from the dropdown menu in the app.
